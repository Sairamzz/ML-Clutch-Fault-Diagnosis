# Clutch Fault Diagnosis Using WiSARD Classifier

This project was done as a part of the MHA 3010 (Machine Learning For Automation) course at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai.

This project explores the use of a weightless neural network (WiSARD classifier) to evaluate the performance of multiple pre-trained deep learning networks for automotive clutch fault diagnosis.
